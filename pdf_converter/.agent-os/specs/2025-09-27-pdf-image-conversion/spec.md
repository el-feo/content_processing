> Spec: PDF to Image Conversion - Extract Images using libvips/pdfium
> Created: 2025-09-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the core PDF to image conversion functionality using libvips with pdfium backend to convert PDF pages into PNG images. This spec focuses on the actual conversion process that occurs after a PDF has been downloaded and before images are uploaded to the destination. The implementation will replace or enhance the existing PDF processing pipeline with a robust, memory-efficient conversion system.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to convert PDF pages to high-quality PNG images so that users can view PDF content as images
- As a system administrator, I want configurable DPI settings so that I can balance image quality with file size and processing time
- As a user, I want all pages of my PDF converted by default so that I get complete document coverage
- As a developer, I want streaming conversion so that memory usage remains efficient for large PDFs
- As a system operator, I want synchronous processing so that error handling and status reporting are straightforward
- As an API consumer, I want consistent PNG output format so that my downstream systems can reliably process the results

## Spec Scope

- Implementation of libvips-based PDF to image conversion engine
- Configuration system for DPI settings (default: 300 DPI)
- PNG output format support with optimized compression
- All-pages conversion with individual page numbering
- Memory-efficient streaming conversion for large documents
- Integration with existing Lambda handler architecture
- Error handling for corrupted or unsupported PDF files
- Conversion progress tracking and logging
- Integration with existing webhook notification system

## Out of Scope

- PDF download functionality (already implemented)
- Image upload to destination
- Authentication and authorization (already implemented)
- Alternative output formats (JPEG, WebP, etc.)
- Asynchronous processing patterns
- PDF metadata extraction beyond page count
- Image post-processing (resizing, cropping, filtering)
- Multi-format input support (non-PDF documents)

## Expected Deliverable

A complete PDF to image conversion system that:

- Integrates seamlessly with the existing Lambda handler
- Converts PDF pages to PNG images using libvips/pdfium
- Maintains memory efficiency through streaming
- Provides configurable quality settings
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Supports webhook notifications for conversion status
- Includes unit tests covering all conversion scenarios
