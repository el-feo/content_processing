**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a serverless PDF to Image Converter as a Function-as-a-Service using AWS Lambda and Ruby, targeting businesses needing secure, scalable PDF processing. Core features include JWT authentication, S3 direct integration via signed URLs, high-quality image extraction using libvips, and asynchronous processing with webhook notifications.

### Context

Organizations struggle with PDF processing due to heavy computational overhead, complex library dependencies, and unpredictable scaling requirements. Existing solutions either require significant infrastructure management or lack the security and integration capabilities needed for enterprise use. The market needs a simple, secure, scalable solution that integrates seamlessly with existing AWS infrastructure.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Server-Based Solution**
   - Pros: Full control, potentially lower per-request cost at high volume
   - Cons: Requires infrastructure management, scaling challenges, higher operational overhead

2. **Third-Party PDF API Service**
   - Pros: No development needed, immediate availability
   - Cons: Data privacy concerns, limited customization, ongoing subscription costs, potential vendor lock-in

3. **Client-Side Processing**
   - Pros: No server costs, immediate processing
   - Cons: Poor performance, browser limitations, security issues, poor user experience with large files

### Rationale

Serverless architecture with AWS Lambda was chosen because it eliminates infrastructure management, provides automatic scaling, and charges only for actual usage. Ruby with libvips offers excellent PDF processing performance with minimal memory footprint. Direct S3 integration reduces latency and improves security by avoiding intermediate storage.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Zero infrastructure management required
- Automatic scaling from 0 to thousands of concurrent requests
- Pay-per-use pricing model reduces costs for variable workloads
- Native AWS integration simplifies deployment for existing AWS users
- Secure document handling with JWT auth and signed URLs

**Negative:**

- Cold start latency for initial requests (mitigated by provisioned concurrency if needed)
- 15-minute Lambda timeout limit for extremely large PDFs
- AWS vendor lock-in for infrastructure components
- Requires AWS account and familiarity with AWS services

## 2025-09-23: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Ruby 3.4 with libvips/pdfium for image processing, Async gem for concurrency, AWS SDK for cloud integration, RSpec for testing, and Docker for containerization. Deploy using AWS SAM for infrastructure as code, Docker, and Localstack for development/testing.

### Context

The technology stack needs to balance performance, maintainability, and deployment simplicity while providing robust PDF processing capabilities. The solution must work within AWS Lambda constraints while delivering high-quality image extraction.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Python with pdf2image**
   - Pros: Popular in Lambda, good library ecosystem
   - Cons: Slower performance, higher memory usage, less efficient for image operations

2. **Node.js with PDF.js**
   - Pros: Fast startup, wide adoption
   - Cons: Limited PDF processing capabilities, poor performance for image operations

3. **Go with pdfcpu**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, small binary size
   - Cons: Limited PDF library options, less mature ecosystem for PDF processing

### Rationale

Ruby with libvips provides the best balance of performance and capability for image processing. Libvips offers superior memory efficiency through streaming, crucial for Lambda's memory constraints. The Async gem enables efficient concurrent processing of PDF pages. Docker containerization ensures consistent dependencies across development and production.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Excellent image processing performance with minimal memory usage
- Mature ecosystem with robust testing tools (RSpec)
- Docker support simplifies dependency management
- Streaming capabilities reduce memory footprint

**Negative:**

- Larger container image due to libvips dependencies
- Ruby less common in Lambda (but fully supported)
- Initial setup complexity for libvips/pdfium compilation
