## 2025-01-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a serverless PDF to image converter service using AWS Lambda and SAM, targeting developers who need reliable document processing without infrastructure overhead. Core features include JWT authentication, asynchronous processing with webhooks, and direct S3 integration for secure file handling.

### Context

The market needs a simple, scalable solution for PDF processing that doesn't require managing servers or complex library installations. Existing solutions either require dedicated infrastructure or lack enterprise security features. This service addresses both concerns with serverless architecture and JWT authentication.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Rails Application**
   - Pros: Familiar framework, rich ecosystem, easier local development
   - Cons: Requires server management, scaling challenges, higher operational costs

2. **Kubernetes-based Microservices**
   - Pros: Fine-grained scaling, technology flexibility, container orchestration
   - Cons: Complex infrastructure, steep learning curve, overkill for single service

3. **Third-party API Integration**
   - Pros: No infrastructure management, immediate availability
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, data privacy concerns, ongoing subscription costs

### Rationale

Serverless architecture with AWS SAM provides the optimal balance of scalability, cost-efficiency, and simplicity. JWT authentication meets enterprise security requirements while keeping integration straightforward. Direct S3 integration eliminates data transfer overhead and security risks.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero infrastructure management required
- Automatic scaling from 0 to thousands of concurrent executions
- Pay-per-use pricing model reduces costs
- Enterprise-grade security with AWS services

**Negative:**
- Cold start latency for initial requests
- AWS vendor lock-in
- Limited execution time (15 minutes max per Lambda)
- Debugging complexity in distributed architecture

## 2025-01-27: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Ruby 3.4 with libvips/pdfium for image processing, Async gem for concurrency, and native Net::HTTP for HTTP operations. Testing with RSpec, local development with LocalStack.

### Context

Need robust PDF processing capabilities with good performance. Ruby provides clean syntax and good AWS SDK support. Libvips offers superior memory efficiency compared to ImageMagick for large PDFs.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Python with pdf2image**
   - Pros: Popular in data processing, extensive libraries
   - Cons: GIL limitations, less elegant async handling

2. **Node.js with Sharp**
   - Pros: Non-blocking I/O, same language as potential frontend
   - Cons: Less mature PDF handling, callback complexity

3. **Go with pdfcpu**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, built-in concurrency
   - Cons: Limited PDF processing libraries, steeper learning curve

### Rationale

Ruby with libvips provides the best balance of developer productivity and performance. The Async gem enables efficient concurrent processing, crucial for multi-page PDFs. LocalStack enables complete offline development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Efficient memory usage with libvips streaming
- Clean, maintainable code with Ruby
- Comprehensive testing with RSpec
- Full AWS simulation with LocalStack

**Negative:**
- Larger Docker images due to libvips/pdfium dependencies
- Ruby performance overhead vs compiled languages
- Limited libvips documentation for advanced features
