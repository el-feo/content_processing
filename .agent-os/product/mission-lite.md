# Product Mission (Lite)

PDF to Image Converter is a serverless function-as-a-service that helps businesses and developers extract high-quality images from PDF documents by providing secure, authenticated API access with AWS S3 integration for seamless document processing workflows.

This service targets DevOps engineers and developers who need reliable, scalable PDF processing without infrastructure overhead. Unlike self-hosted solutions or generic PDF APIs, it provides direct S3 integration with signed URLs, JWT authentication, and asynchronous processing with webhook notifications, resulting in 90% less operational overhead and 3x faster processing times.
