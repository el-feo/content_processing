# Product Mission (Lite)

PDF Converter Service is a serverless document processing platform that helps developers convert PDFs to images at scale by providing secure, asynchronous processing with webhook notifications.

The service targets SaaS companies and enterprise systems needing reliable PDF-to-image conversion without infrastructure overhead. Unlike traditional PDF processing services requiring dedicated servers, our serverless architecture provides automatic scaling from zero to thousands of concurrent conversions with enterprise-grade JWT authentication and secure S3 integration, resulting in 90% cost reduction and simplified integration through a single JSON API endpoint.
