# Product Mission

## Pitch

PDF to Image Converter is a serverless function-as-a-service that helps businesses and developers extract high-quality images from PDF documents by providing secure, authenticated API access with AWS S3 integration for seamless document processing workflows.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **SaaS Companies**: Organizations needing to process user-uploaded PDFs and extract images for display or further processing
- **Document Management Systems**: Platforms requiring PDF preview generation and page extraction capabilities
- **Enterprise Applications**: Internal tools needing secure, scalable PDF processing without managing infrastructure

### User Personas

**DevOps Engineer** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Platform Engineer / Infrastructure Lead
- **Context:** Managing microservices architecture with document processing requirements
- **Pain Points:** Complex PDF processing libraries, scaling issues with image extraction, security concerns with document handling
- **Goals:** Reliable PDF processing, minimal infrastructure management, secure document handling

**Product Developer** (22-35 years old)
- **Role:** Full-Stack Developer / API Integration Specialist
- **Context:** Building features that require PDF document visualization and processing
- **Pain Points:** Lack of native PDF support in web browsers, heavy client-side processing, complex library dependencies
- **Goals:** Simple API integration, fast processing times, reliable webhook notifications

## The Problem

### Heavy PDF Processing Overhead

Many applications need to extract images from PDFs but struggle with the computational overhead and complex dependencies required. Installing and maintaining PDF processing libraries across different environments consumes significant development time and resources.

**Our Solution:** Serverless function with pre-configured libvips and pdfium for instant PDF to image conversion.

### Insecure Document Handling

Transferring and processing sensitive documents through multiple systems creates security vulnerabilities. Organizations need authenticated, encrypted document processing that doesn't expose sensitive data.

**Our Solution:** JWT-authenticated requests with signed S3 URLs for secure, direct document transfer without intermediate storage.

### Unpredictable Scaling Requirements

PDF processing loads vary dramatically, from single pages to thousands of documents. Traditional servers either waste resources during idle times or fail during peak loads, costing businesses in both scenarios.

**Our Solution:** AWS Lambda auto-scaling that handles bursts automatically while charging only for actual usage.

## Differentiators

### Zero Infrastructure Management

Unlike self-hosted PDF processing solutions, we provide a fully managed serverless function that eliminates server provisioning, patching, and scaling concerns. This results in 90% reduction in operational overhead and infrastructure costs.

### Native S3 Integration

Unlike generic PDF APIs that require multiple file transfers, we work directly with signed S3 URLs for both source and destination. This results in 3x faster processing times and eliminates data transfer bottlenecks.

### Asynchronous Processing with Webhooks

Unlike synchronous PDF processors that timeout on large files, we process asynchronously and notify via webhooks when complete. This enables processing of PDFs with thousands of pages without connection timeouts.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure API access with token-based authentication for request validation
- **S3 Direct Integration:** Process PDFs directly from S3 using signed URLs without intermediate storage
- **High-Quality Image Extraction:** Extract images at configurable DPI using libvips for optimal quality
- **Page-by-Page Processing:** Extract individual pages as separate images for granular control
- **Webhook Notifications:** Receive success/failure notifications when processing completes

### Performance Features

- **Async Processing:** Non-blocking request handling using Ruby Async for concurrent operations
- **Stream Upload:** Stream extracted images directly to S3 destination without local storage
- **Auto-scaling:** Automatic Lambda scaling to handle from 1 to 10,000+ concurrent requests

### Future Capabilities

- **Text Extraction:** OCR and text extraction from PDF pages for searchable content
- **Watermarking:** Add custom watermarks to extracted images for branding or security
- **Format Options:** Support multiple output formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP) with quality settings
