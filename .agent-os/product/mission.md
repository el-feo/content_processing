# Product Mission

## Pitch

PDF Converter Service is an open source serverless document processing platform that helps developers convert PDFs to images at scale by providing secure, asynchronous processing with webhook notifications.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **SaaS Companies**: Organizations needing document processing capabilities integrated into their applications
- **Digital Publishers**: Companies converting PDF documents to web-friendly formats for online viewing
- **Enterprise Systems**: Internal applications requiring document transformation for workflows

### User Personas

**Application Developer** (25-40 years old)

- **Role:** Backend Engineer / Full-Stack Developer
- **Context:** Building document management systems or content platforms
- **Pain Points:** Complex PDF processing libraries, scaling issues, infrastructure management overhead
- **Goals:** Quick integration, reliable processing, minimal infrastructure maintenance

**DevOps Engineer** (30-45 years old)

- **Role:** Infrastructure / Platform Engineer
- **Context:** Managing document processing pipelines for enterprise applications
- **Pain Points:** Scaling document processing, monitoring failures, security compliance
- **Goals:** Automated scaling, comprehensive monitoring, secure handling of sensitive documents

## The Problem

### Inefficient PDF Processing at Scale

Most applications struggle with PDF to image conversion due to heavy computational requirements and complex library dependencies. This results in blocked application threads, memory issues, and poor user experience with processing times exceeding 30+ seconds for large documents.

**Our Solution:** Serverless, asynchronous processing with automatic scaling and webhook notifications.

### Complex Integration Requirements

Setting up PDF processing requires installing and managing multiple system libraries (libvips, pdfium), handling memory management, and building retry logic. Development teams spend weeks integrating and months maintaining these systems.

**Our Solution:** Simple JSON API with JWT authentication that handles all complexity behind a single endpoint.

## Differentiators

### Serverless Architecture

Unlike traditional PDF processing services that require dedicated servers, we provide automatic scaling from zero to thousands of concurrent conversions. This results in 90% cost reduction during low-usage periods and instant scaling during peak demand.

### Security-First Design

Unlike open PDF conversion APIs, we implement JWT authentication with AWS Secrets Manager, signed S3 URLs for data transfer, and minimal error exposure. This results in enterprise-grade security without complexity.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure API access with token-based authentication using AWS Secrets Manager
- **Async Processing:** Non-blocking PDF conversion with webhook notifications on completion
- **S3 Integration:** Direct processing from/to S3 using signed URLs for secure data transfer
- **Page-by-Page Extraction:** Convert each PDF page to individual high-quality images
- **Error Reporting:** Detailed failure reports identifying specific pages that couldn't be processed

### Collaboration Features

- **Webhook Notifications:** Real-time updates sent to client endpoints with processing status
- **Unique ID Tracking:** Client-provided IDs maintained throughout processing for easy correlation
