# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-27-pdf-download-s3/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **HTTP Client Integration** - Add HTTP client functionality to download files from signed S3 URLs using Ruby's Net::HTTP or aws-sdk-s3
- **Request Validation** - Extend existing URL validation to verify S3 signed URL format and accessibility
- **Memory Streaming** - Implement streaming download to handle large PDF files within Lambda's 2048MB memory constraint
- **Error Handling** - Add specific error handling for HTTP timeouts, network failures, and S3 access denied responses
- **Logging Enhancement** - Add download progress and file size logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Content Validation** - Verify downloaded content is a valid PDF file before processing

## Approach

1. **Download Implementation**
   - Use Ruby's Net::HTTP for HTTP/HTTPS downloads from signed S3 URLs
   - Implement streaming download to avoid loading entire file into memory at once
   - Add timeout configuration for both connection and read operations

2. **URL Processing**
   - Parse and validate S3 signed URL format before attempting download
   - Extract bucket and key information for logging purposes
   - Verify URL is accessible before beginning download

3. **Memory Management**
   - Stream downloaded content directly to MiniMagick for processing
   - Use temporary files for intermediate storage if needed
   - Implement cleanup of temporary resources

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry logic for transient network failures
   - Add exponential backoff for S3 rate limiting
   - Provide clear error messages for different failure scenarios

## External Dependencies

**net-http** - Built-in Ruby HTTP client for downloading files from signed URLs
- **Justification:** Already available in Ruby standard library, no additional dependencies needed for basic HTTP downloads

**aws-sdk-s3** - AWS SDK for Ruby S3 client (if direct S3 integration preferred)
- **Justification:** Provides optimized S3 download with built-in retry logic and streaming capabilities, already commonly used in AWS Lambda environments
