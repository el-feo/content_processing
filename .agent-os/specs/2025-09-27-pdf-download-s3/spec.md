# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: PDF Download from S3
> Created: 2025-09-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement PDF download functionality within the existing `/convert` endpoint to retrieve PDF files from S3 using signed URLs provided in the request. This enables the Lambda function to access and download PDF content for subsequent conversion processing, establishing the foundation for the PDF-to-image conversion pipeline.

## User Stories

### PDF Download for Conversion

As a developer using the PDF converter service, I want to provide a signed S3 URL for a PDF file in my conversion request, so that the Lambda function can securely download the PDF content for processing.

The workflow involves sending a POST request to `/convert` with a `source` field containing a signed S3 URL. The Lambda function authenticates the request using JWT, validates the signed URL, downloads the PDF content from S3, and prepares it for conversion processing. This provides secure, temporary access to PDF files without requiring permanent storage credentials.

## Spec Scope

1. **PDF Download Implementation** - Add functionality to download PDF files from S3 using signed URLs provided in the request
2. **URL Validation Enhancement** - Extend existing URL validation to specifically handle S3 signed URLs
3. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling for download failures, network issues, and invalid URLs
4. **Memory Management** - Ensure efficient memory usage when downloading large PDF files within Lambda constraints

## Out of Scope

- PDF conversion to images (separate spec)
- Signed URL generation (URLs provided by client)
- File storage or caching beyond processing duration
- Image upload to destination (separate spec)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced `/convert` endpoint that successfully downloads PDF files from provided signed S3 URLs
2. Proper error responses for download failures with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. Memory-efficient PDF download handling that works within Lambda's 2048MB memory limit
