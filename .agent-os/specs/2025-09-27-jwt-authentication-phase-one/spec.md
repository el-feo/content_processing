# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: JWT Authentication Phase 1
> Created: 2025-09-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement JWT token validation for the PDF Converter Service to secure all API endpoints. This phase focuses on validating existing JWT tokens (not issuing them) using a shared secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The authentication layer will protect all endpoints and return appropriate HTTP status codes for authentication failures.

## User Stories

**As a client application developer**, I want to authenticate API requests using JWT tokens so that only authorized applications can access the PDF conversion service.

**As a system administrator**, I want JWT secrets securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager so that sensitive authentication data is properly protected.

**As an API consumer**, I want clear HTTP status codes when authentication fails so that I can properly handle and debug authentication issues.

**As a service operator**, I want all API endpoints protected by JWT authentication so that unauthorized access is prevented across the entire service.

## Spec Scope

- JWT token validation for all API endpoints
- Integration with AWS Secrets Manager for JWT shared secret storage
- Proper HTTP status code responses (401 for missing/invalid tokens)
- Token signature validation (no specific claims verification required)
- Authentication middleware that can be applied to all routes
- Error handling and logging for authentication failures

## Out of Scope

- JWT token issuance/generation
- JWT secret rotation mechanisms
- Claims validation beyond signature verification
- User management or authorization beyond authentication
- Rate limiting or throttling
- Multi-tenant JWT secret management

## Expected Deliverable

A secure JWT authentication layer that validates tokens against a shared secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager, protecting all API endpoints and returning appropriate HTTP status codes for authentication success/failure scenarios.
