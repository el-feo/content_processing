# JWT Authentication - Lite Summary

Implement JWT-based authentication middleware for the PDF processing Lambda function to secure API endpoints and validate incoming requests. This feature provides secure access control for the PDF-to-image conversion service, validates tokens at the API Gateway level, and ensures only authenticated users can generate S3 signed URLs for document operations.

## Key Points

- JWT token validation at API Gateway level using Lambda authorizer
- Secure access control for PDF-to-image conversion endpoints
- Integration with existing AWS SAM serverless architecture
