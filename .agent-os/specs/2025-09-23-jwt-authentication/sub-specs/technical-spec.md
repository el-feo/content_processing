# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-23-jwt-authentication/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-23
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Implement JWT validation using the `jwt` Ruby gem with RS256 algorithm support
- Create a reusable authentication module that can be included in Lambda handlers
- Configure API Gateway Lambda authorizer with caching enabled (300 second TTL)
- Implement request validation using JSON Schema for payload structure verification
- Support both Authorization Bearer tokens and custom X-Auth-Token headers
- Extract user_id, permissions, and expiry claims from validated JWT tokens
- Return standardized error responses with correlation IDs for debugging
- Implement token expiry validation with configurable grace period (default 5 minutes)
- Add CloudWatch metrics for authentication success/failure rates
- Support environment-specific JWT public keys via environment variables

## Approach

## External Dependencies

- **jwt (Ruby gem ~> 2.8)** - Industry standard JWT validation library for Ruby
- **Justification:** Required for secure JWT token parsing and validation with RS256 algorithm support

- **json-schema (Ruby gem ~> 4.0)** - JSON Schema validator for request payload validation
- **Justification:** Ensures incoming request payloads match expected structure before processing
