# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: JWT Authentication and Request Validation
> Created: 2025-09-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement JWT-based authentication middleware for the PDF processing Lambda function to secure API endpoints and validate incoming requests. This feature will provide secure access control for the PDF-to-image conversion service, ensuring only authenticated users can process documents.

## User Stories

### API Consumer Authentication

As a developer consuming the PDF processing API, I want to authenticate using JWT tokens, so that I can securely access the conversion service.

The workflow begins when a developer receives JWT credentials from our service. They include the JWT token in the Authorization header of their API requests. The Lambda function validates the token before processing any PDF conversion requests. If the token is invalid or expired, the function returns a 401 Unauthorized response with clear error messaging. Valid tokens allow the request to proceed to the PDF processing logic.

### Secure File Access Control

As a system administrator, I want to ensure that S3 signed URLs are required and provided by the user, so that sensitive documents remain protected.

When an authenticated request is received, the system validates the request parameters. The middleware checks that the requested S3 parameters are valid, only after successful validation does the system proceed with S3 upload/download operations. This prevents unauthorized access to stored documents and maintains audit trails of all file access attempts.

## Spec Scope

1. **JWT Token Validation Middleware** - Implement Ruby middleware to verify JWT tokens in Lambda function headers
2. **API Gateway Authorizer Integration** - Configure Lambda authorizer for API Gateway to validate tokens at the edge
3. **Request Parameter Validation** - Validate incoming request payloads against defined schemas
4. **Error Response Standardization** - Implement consistent error responses for authentication/validation failures
5. **Token Claims Processing** - Extract and utilize user permissions and metadata from JWT claims

## Out of Scope

- User registration and JWT token generation endpoints
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration
- Multi-factor authentication
- API key authentication as an alternative to JWT

## Expected Deliverable

1. JWT tokens in Authorization headers are validated on all protected endpoints with appropriate 401/403 responses
2. Request validation rejects malformed payloads with detailed error messages before processing
3. API Gateway authorizer successfully caches validation results for improved performance
